### Case Introduction
#### Hacking-from-Home

Most of us at Accenture have been working from home due to the pandemic. Working on projects while managing your household has been a juggling act for all of us. 

The kids make surprise visits to your room during an important client call. Your physical fitness is lacking as you barely leave the house. The workdays get longer and it’s becoming harder to distinguish between work and private life. 

From time-management, to fitness, to mental health, virtual meetups & games etc. In this new way of working, we would like to give you, the hackers, the opportunity to think of ways to improve the WFH experience for the hundreds of thousands of people like you & us who are embarking on the journey to the future of work.
